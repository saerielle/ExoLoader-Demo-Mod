# ExoLoader Demo Mod
Demo mod for [ExoLoader](https://github.com/Pandemonium14/ExoLoader) (mod for I Was a Teenage Exocolonist that makes adding custom characters easier)

This is a very lighthearted mod/custom content. The main purpose is to showcase different capabilities of ExoLoader, focusing mainly on characters and their setups.

# Characters
## Template
_A character template. Made to make adding characters easier. They/them_

The OG character template (to not be confused with Template OC by Pandemonium, they do not have their own mod yet). Adjusted for updated version of ExoLoader.

**Features**
- Character that does not age (like colony's adults or Sym) - uses the same art throughout the game
- Does not usually hang out in the colony, instead can be found on expedition maps (all but Swamps). Can be found in the colony during "destroyed" scene at the start of year 15
- Has one of the fillbars in their character panel depend on a memory flag `mem_templateVisited` (similar to Tammy's confidence fillbar)

## Placeholder [Hold]
_A moody boy who's just holding this spot until someone better comes along. Occasionally glitches into [todo: placeholder text] when nervous as a side-effect of his genetic enhancement. He/him_

A very basic Stratos-friend character with nothing much going on. His setup is very cut and dry and easy to understand.

**Features**
- Start-of-game friend option
- Ages the same way as other friends
- Present on the colony map during all seasons
- Has introduction story that unlocks Sam on the map, as well as two jobs added by this demo

## Sample [Sam]
_An enthusiastic beta tester who's always trying the latest experimental features. Curious and experimental by nature. Has a tendency to break things just to see what happens. She/he_

Very experimental character that utilizes a lot of features of the loader. Very fourth wall breaking. I tried to make him/her funny, I may have failed, who knows.

**Features**
- Some story events with Sam swap Sam's gender between male and female (configuration changes overworld sprite, story sprites, dialogue color, pronouns in the character info, etc.)
- Sam has custom aging setup that makes her/him age at the same in-game time as other characters with addition of 2nd gendered appearance, but similar mechanics can be used to have characters whose art stages do not match the game's base logic
- Is not present on the map during Glow for the first half of the game
- Does not appear on the map by default until a memory flag `mem_map_demosam` is set - same as base game's characters (ExoLoader shows custom characters on map by default otherwise) - this memory flag is set in either intro story when choosing Sam as a childhood friend or in Hold's introduction story
- Showcases a custom dating flag between two characters (sets in Sam's 60 friendship event)

# Jobs
## Visit Template
The OG custom job, now migrated to Expeditions menu - because why not? Disabled during wet. Showcases base setup for the job as well as Template's `mem_templateVisited` flag that shows in the game stories in the same way as Tammy's confidence.

## Stress Testing
A showcase of a relax-type job, located in Engineering

# Other Content
This demo also has examples of custom achievements, backgrounds, endings, cards, collectibles, story structures, etc.

If you are interested in how any specific thing can be implemented using ExoLoader, feel free to reach out to me and I may add an example of that to this Demo :)
